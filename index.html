Hello. My name is Nicholas Monte. The current work experience I have with Cognizant Technology Solutions simply involves the research and development of Billboard top 100 Artists, but for YouTube Music. 

The value I contribute is my accountability towards being people focused first and a problem solver. I am confident no other applicant can match my various experiences working from start-ups, owning my own business, and being an accomplished Web Developer. Working for start-ups has given me many opportunities to develop soft and hard skills such as being able to communicate effectively and to utilize web development tools for my own business. One prominent accomplishment I have was creating my own mobile food business Big Nick's Bakes Pizzeria. This provided me with the knowledge of business operations and most importantly top notch customer service. 

Colleagues describe me as a progressive and a driven team leader.

I am pursuing opportunities that can hone in on my web development skills. I can be reached through this profile, or by phone at: 714-906-4034.

Thank you. I sincerely appreciate your interest.
